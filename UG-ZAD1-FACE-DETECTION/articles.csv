,Platform-based task assignment for social manufacturing (PBTA4SM): State-of-the-art review and future directions,Yuguang Bao and Xinguo Ming and Xianyu Zhang and Fei Tao and Jiewu Leng and Yang Liu,Journal of Manufacturing Systems,2025,Science@Direct,328-350,78,"Mass individualization is calling for a more sustainable manufacturing paradigm which can address the paradoxes of diversity, complexity, and affordability. Social Manufacturing (SM) represents a democratized servitization trend trying to reshape the traditional production relationship between consumers and manufacturers. To achieve the SM visions, new operational mechanisms for SM should be constructed to overcome the challenges of information sharing, accuracy, efficiency, security, sovereignty, etc. The survey found that task assignment (TA) is one of the foundational mechanisms for the implementation of regular autonomous manufacturing systems, as well as the role of TA is further amplified for distributed collaborative environments. Therefore, inspired by the relevant research of management science, Platform-based Task Assignment (PBTA) is proposed to distinguish and conceptualize this different research topic. In SM platforms, the diverse capacities and resources can be shared, so that knowing ""who can do” and “select whom to do"" is more important than knowing ""how to do"". Furthermore, the studies on TA for SM present a difference from the previous studies on TA in manufacturing. From a perspective of supply-demand mapping, PBTA illustrates the foundational operational mechanism for SM attracting many researchers’ attention from different fields. Meanwhile, research on PBTA is also required for the platform practices in the era of digital, shared, and platform economy. Given the academic importance and practical value, this survey carefully selects 250 valuable research articles relevant to PBTA for SM. A novel workflow model and knowledge framework, namely PBTA4SM, is proposed to identify and organize the critical issues and challenges. This study shows the state-of-the-art research advancement of PBTA including task design considerations, modelling methods, typical engineering problems, algorithms, decision patterns, key activities, and governance mechanisms.

,Alert Fatigue in Security Operations Centres: Research Challenges and Opportunities,"Tariq, Shahroz and Baruwal Chhetri, Mohan and Nepal, Surya and Paris, Cecile",ACM Comput. Surv.,2025,ACM Digital Library,,57,"A security operations centre (SOC) is a facility where teams of security professionals, supported by advanced technologies and processes, work together to monitor, detect, and respond to cybersecurity incidents. With advances in AI technology, most of the SOC functions are increasingly becoming AI-driven. Among these, real-time alert monitoring and triage is particularly important. Recent studies, by both industry and academia, have highlighted the problem of alert fatigue and burnout in SOC. Several solutions have been proposed in the literature and by the industry to address this problem. In this article, we review the existing literature and industry solutions on alert fatigue mitigation through the lenses of automation, augmentation, and human–AI collaboration. Based on the review, we identify four major causes of alert fatigue in SOC. We also examine the shortcomings of existing solutions and propose several potential research directions leveraging AI. By providing a comprehensive analysis of the state-of-the-art approaches and their limitations, this study contributes to the existing literature in an important field of study. We anticipate that it will inspire new research directions for addressing alert fatigue not just in SOCs but across other Command and Control (C2) domains as well.",,10.1145/3723158,https://doi.org/10.1145/3723158,,,"Security operation centre, SOC, alert triage, alert fatigue, automation, augmentation, collaboration",Association for Computing Machinery,0360-0300,,,,"46033,8088888889","46034,0727546296",AMalinowska,,Accepted

,Dual task scheduling strategy for personalized multi-objective optimization of cycle time and fatigue in human-robot collaboration,Saahil Chand and Yuqian Lu,Manufacturing Letters,2023,Science@Direct,88-95,35,"The increased adoption of collaborative robots into human dominated work cells improves production efficiency of hard-to-automate manufacturing tasks. System-centric task scheduling objectives aim to fully utilize all available agents, often physically burdening workers with schedules designed maximized efficiency. Therefore, the modeling and optimization of human fatigue, as one of the main contributors to efficiency decline and adverse health conditions, is significant to task scheduling in Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC). Furthermore, HRC teams often involve drastically different workers with differing capabilities and muscle strengths – with direct implication toward their personalized fatigue responses. As such, we present a dual scheduling strategy for personalized multi-objective optimization of cycle time and fatigue considering recovery in HRC. The scheduling strategy involves two fatigue minimization objectives which either minimize the team’s fatigue state or an individual worker’s fatigue state. This balances fatigue accumulation between workers, providing targeted rest and recovery to specific workers while maintaining production efficiency. We designed a custom NSGA-III genetic algorithm for simultaneously minimizing cycle time and fatigue.

,Task Allocation in Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC) Based on Task Characteristics and Agent Capability for Mold Assembly,Yee Yeng Liau and Kwangyeol Ryu,Procedia Manufacturing,2020,Science@Direct,179-186,51,"The involvement of repetitive motion with force and heavy component handling during the manual mold assembly causes an ergonomic problem that harms the musculoskeletal system on the human worker. This ergonomic problem can be eliminated using a robot. However, the traditional automation system is impractical to be implemented in the mold assembly because of the complexity of the customized mold structure. Hence, human-robot collaboration (HRC) systems became the potential solution to improve the working conditions with the assistance of a robot while adapting to the frequent change over in the mold assembly operation. In this paper, we propose a task allocation model for the HRC system that consists of three agents who are one human and two robots to cope with heavy part handling and the diversity of tasks in the mold assembly. First, we decompose the assembly operation into functional actions. Second, we evaluate the action assignment using the Analytic Network Process (ANP) based on the action characteristics and agent capability. Third, we allocate the functional action to the agents in the HRC work cell using the Genetic Algorithm (GA) to minimize the operation cycle time and maximize the agent capability. The outcome of this paper is to contribute to the expansion of the HRC system with one human and two robots in the mold assembly operation.

,An approach to task scheduling in an end-of-line quality assurance situation with human-robot cooperation,Alexander Hämmerle and Martin J. Kollingbaum and Florian Steiner and Gerhard Ebenhofer and Fabian Widmoser and Markus Ikeda and Harald Bauer and Andreas Pichler,Procedia Computer Science,2025,Science@Direct,524-532,253,"In zero defect manufacturing, final inspection and rework activities play an important role. Such an end-of-line process has particular characteristics that pose difficulties in scheduling rework activities. In order to achieve zero defect, a workpiece may have to undergo inspection and rework multiple times. Neither the number of rework cycles nor the duration of rework activities can be reliably predicted. In this paper, an agent-oriented approach for managing a mixed human-robot team to perform final inspection and rework is presented. The task assignment to workers and robots takes place according to a concept of agents “pulling” tasks to be performed by either a worker or a robot (such as a rework operation) from a pool of currently available work. This selection is guided by the principle of human initiative – human workers indicate when they are ready to perform a next task.

Tourist congestion is a common issue that can significantly affect service quality. To maintain a high level of service in congested environments, many attractions offer priority services, such as the VIP services commonly offered in malls or amusement parks, which grant priority access to specific customers and allow them to reduce or even eliminate waiting times. By integrating such priority discipline, businesses can enhance the satisfaction of high-priority tourists while improving profitability. In this paper, a new tourist trip design problem that incorporates two priority discipline strategies is introduced, for the first time representing the priority discipline as constraints within the model to ensure that the solutions strictly adhere to the discipline. To address this problem, a branch-and-bound algorithm is proposed for solving small-scale instances, and an adaptive large neighborhood search algorithm is developed to efficiently handle large-scale instances, with a customized heuristic rule used to determine the visiting orders at each attraction.

Therefore, manufacturing systems should timely respond to meet changing demands and conditions in the factory, in the supply network, and in customer needs. However, current manufacturing systems fail to adapt to dynamic production environments via changing system configurations and production plans while maintaining stable production performance. Therefore, a manufacturing system is required to be capable of self-optimizing manufacturing operations to achieve flexible, autonomous, and error-tolerant production in the mass personalization context. In this article, we systematically reviewed the literature on Self-Organizing Manufacturing Systems (SOMS) and proposed a complete concept of Self-Organizing Manufacturing Network (SOMN) as the next-generation manufacturing automation technologies for achieving mass personalization. Our review started by tracing the roots, origin, and state-of-the-art research of SOMS and concluded that the existing SOMS work could not achieve the mass personalization goal. As a focus of this review paper, we systematically discussed self-organizing manufacturing's functional requirements to achieve mass personalization and proposed Self-Organizing Manufacturing Network. The concept, functions and essential technological system components (i.e., system modeling and control architecture, peer communications, and adaptive manufacturing control) are discussed by reviewing existing work and highlighting transferrable knowledge from other disciplines. Future research challenges are also discussed.",,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmsy.2021.04.016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278612521000960,,,"Mass personalization, Industry 4.0, Smart manufacturing, Manufacturing control, Self-organizing manufacturing network, Job shop scheduling",,0278-6125,,,,"46033,8136111111","46033,8136111111",AMalinowska,,Accepted
,Artificial Intelligence Helps Teachers Personalise Their Teaching--Take ChatGPT as an Example,"Zhang, Shaojun and He, Xiangchun and Zhou, Yaxin and Jiang, Ruishuang and Han, Yuqi and Guo, Xue",,2025,ACM Digital Library,200–205,,"With the continuous development of science and technology, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become an important driving force for innovation in the field of education, especially advanced AI language models such as ChatGPT, which shows great potential in assisting teachers to design, implement and evaluate personalised teaching due to its excellent language comprehension and generative ability. Nevertheless, how to use ChatGPT to help teachers carry out personalised teaching has yet to be explored. Therefore, this paper explores and analyses the ways in which ChatGPT can help teachers carry out personalised teaching based on the connotation of ChatGPT and personalised teaching, and discusses the challenges faced when using ChatGPT to assist teachers in carrying out personalised teaching, from the perspective of the three aspects of teaching: lesson planning, instruction, and evaluation and feedback. It also discusses the challenges faced when using ChatGPT to assist teachers in personalised teaching and proposes strategies to address them. The study shows that artificial intelligence can make teachers more scientific, precise, intelligent and diversified in the process of implementing personalised teaching.",,10.1145/3711403.3711438,https://doi.org/10.1145/3711403.3711438,,,"Artificial Intelligence, ChatGPT, Personalised Teaching",Association for Computing Machinery,,,,,"46033,8088888889","46033,8088888889",AMalinowska,,Accepted
,Bridging the Gap Between Time Management Research and Task Management App Design: A Study on the Integration of Planning Fallacy Mitigation Strategies,"Ahmetoglu, Yoana and Brumby, Duncan and Cox, Anna",,2024,ACM Digital Library,,,"Accurate time estimations are vital for meeting deadlines and reducing work-related stress, yet individuals frequently succumb to a wide-spread cognitive bias, the planning fallacy, resulting in poor time management. This research article reports on two studies aimed at addressing this challenge. First, through a review of the psychological literature, we identify four key strategies recommended by research for supporting accurate time estimations in daily tasks. These strategies serve as the foundation for the second study, where we conduct a functionality analysis of prevalent personal task management apps to investigate their alignment with the identified strategies. Our analysis reveals a significant disparity: while research-informed strategies are recommended, they are rarely implemented to a good standard in current apps. This discrepancy emphasizes the importance of addressing this gap between theory and practice. By highlighting the need for future efforts to focus on aiding workers in task duration estimation, this study identifies opportunities for improving the design of task management software to enhance user productivity and alleviate stress.",,10.1145/3663384.3663404,https://doi.org/10.1145/3663384.3663404,,,"Functionality Review, Literature Review, Personal Task Management, Planning, Planning Fallacy, Time Management, To-Do List",Association for Computing Machinery,,,,,"46033,8257407407","46034,0725",AMalinowska,,Accepted
,Task Allocation in Human-Robot Collaboration: A Simulation-based approach to optimize Operator's Productivity and Ergonomics,Alessio Baratta and Antonio Cimino and Francesco Longo and Giovanni Mirabelli and Letizia Nicoletti,Procedia Computer Science,2024,Science@Direct,688-697,232,"This paper delves into the transformative realm of Industry 4.0, emphasizing the pivotal role of Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC) in redefining manufacturing landscapes. Central to this revolution is the integration of cyber-physical systems, automation, and the Internet of Things (IoT), culminating in the advent of smart manufacturing. We explore how HRC fosters a synergistic work environment, blurring the traditional boundaries between human workers and robotic counterparts. This research emphasizes the importance of intelligent task allocation in optimizing operational efficiency while safeguarding the ergonomic well-being of human operators. A simulation-based approach is presented, focusing on task allocation within HRC contexts to enhance both human operators' productivity and fatigue levels. The study provides an analysis of fatigue dynamics and its repercussions on industrial settings. The paper outlines various collaborative scenarios, including sole human operation, robot support, a Flexible Workstation (F-WS) support, and combined robot-FWS support, evaluated through a case study of an assembly station. The results underscore the tangible benefits of integrating robotic and F-WS support, demonstrating a balanced improvement in processing speed, operator efficiency, and a significant reduction in fatigue accumulation. In conclusion, this paper advocates for a balanced, human-centric approach to Industry 4.0, where the integration of HRC and ergonomic considerations pave the way for a sustainable, efficient, and health-preserving industrial future.",,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procs.2024.01.068,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050924000681,,,"Human-Robot Collaboration, Fatigue, Ergonomics, Task Allocation",,1877-0509,,5th International Conference on Industry 4.0 and Smart Manufacturing (ISM 2023),,"46033,8142708333","46034,0725578704",AMalinowska,,Accepted
,Digital twin-based framework for an efficient execution of CPPS reconfiguration through human–robot collaboration,Francesco Giuseppe Ciampi and Thierno M.L. Diallo and Faïda Mhenni and Jean-Yves Choley and Stanislao Patalano,Journal of Manufacturing Systems,2025,Science@Direct,157-174,83,"This paper presents a Digital Twin-based framework to support the reconfiguration process of Cyber–Physical Production Systems (CPPSs) through human–robot collaboration and Industry 5.0 enabling technologies. The proposed approach integrates a Mixed Reality (MR) module into the digital twin architecture to enhance human–machine interaction, data visualisation, and robot programming. It also incorporates Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), a hybrid methodology that combines machine learning and physical modelling to improve prediction accuracy and physical consistency. A proof of concept implementation of the framework is carried out on the reconfiguration of a real-world production line within a research platform. The communication mechanism between system modules is tested and discussed in detail. Additionally, the use of PINNs for predicting the energy consumption of a mobile robotic system involved in the reconfiguration task is implemented and benchmarked. The mobile robotic system integrates an AMR (Autonomous Mobile Robot) and a Cobot (collaborative robotic arm). Results show that the proposed model outperforms conventional physics-based and data-driven methods, significantly enhancing the predictive capabilities of the digital twin and broadening its applicability beyond the specific use case.",,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmsy.2025.09.001,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278612525002213,,,"Cyber–physical production system, Reconfiguration, Human–robot collaboration, Digital twin, Physics-informed neural network",,0278-6125,,,,"46033,8142708333","46034,0725810185",AMalinowska,,Accepted
,A competence-time-quality scheduling model of multi-skilled staff for IT project portfolio,Rong Chen and Changyong Liang and Dongxiao Gu and Huimin Zhao,Computers & Industrial Engineering,2020,Science@Direct,106183,139,"Technical professionals are a key factor for IT product development. In an IT company, it is common for an employee to hold multiple skills. Multi-skilled staff increases the difficulty of project portfolio scheduling and staff assignment. This paper helps R&D managers cope with the problem by proposing a multi-objective optimization model of project portfolio scheduling and multi-skilled staff assignment. The model considers three objectives with strong practicality, i.e., staff skill enhancement, development cycle time, and product quality, and incorporates skill cultivation through a learning curve. We then propose an improved multi-objective Pareto ant colony optimization algorithm combining genetic operators to find an approximate Pareto solution set. Personalized decision rules with strong practicability are also discussed for selecting an appropriate solution. A case study in a leading electrical device company in China demonstrates the utility of the proposed model and algorithm.",,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cie.2019.106183,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360835219306527,,,"Project scheduling, Multi-skill, Staff assignment, Multi-objective optimization, IT project portfolio, Ant colony optimization",,0360-8352,,,,"46033,8142708333","46034,0725925926",AMalinowska,,Accepted
